# BootstrapBookingForm
This is intro level bootstrap project that I made for my Full-Stack Web Dev course in college. 
I used Toastr, Jquery, Bootsrap libraries to make this booking form. There are 3 files in this project that are linked together. 
Download all the files, put them in the same folder and the open the html file using any browser you use.
